    <p>One of the duties of front-end developers is to provide the best experience to users regardless of what
        device or browser they are using.
        This was not always the prevailing attitude, and the companies that made browsers were partly to
        blame. In the early days of the web, browser makers were fighting a war. Each would invent new
        nonstandard features in an attempt to out-do the others. In response, web developers came up with
        schemes for detecting which browser was requesting a document and what screen size was being used.
        Based on this information, a different version of the document was served out.
        Sadly, this meant that front-end development became weighed down with creating multiple copies
        of every page on a site, each copy built with the markup and styles that would work for a specific
        version of a browser running at a particular screen size. Maintaining all of these copies was both time
        consuming and frustrating.</p>
